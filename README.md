# Motio

**Team task planning on a timeline.**

Plan work across people and projects on a drag-and-drop timeline,
keep the whole team's workload visible — self-hosted, with SSO out of the box.

## ✨ Features

- 📅 **Timeline** — drag-and-drop planner grouped by people or by project, with day / week / calendar views; milestones and time off sit on the same grid. Drag a task past the edge of the screen and the timeline scrolls along.
- ✅ **Tasks with depth** — subtasks, repeating series, priorities, tags, rich descriptions with pasted images, comments with @mentions and screenshots.
- 👥 **Team** — members and groups, each person's current and past tasks at a glance.
- 📁 **Projects and customers** — project cards with their team and customer contacts, a workspace-wide contact list; people you have entered before are suggested as you type.
- 📊 **Dashboard** — configurable widgets and a department workload heatmap; a daily brief once a day and release notes right in the app.
- 🔔 **Notifications** — in-app inbox plus browser push; installable as a PWA, push works on iPhone too.
- 📱 **Works on phones** — a dedicated mobile layer for the timeline, tasks, team and projects.
- 🏢 **Workspaces and roles** — `viewer` / `editor` / `admin`, invitations, owner transfer, leaving a workspace.
- 🔐 **SSO out of the box** — sign-in through Keycloak; sign-up is self-service (the app opens the Keycloak registration form), while invitations and account deletion happen in the app itself, Keycloak is the identity store.
- 💾 **Backups built in** — daily backups of the database, media and Keycloak with retention, upload/download and one-click restore from the admin console.
- 🗄 **Super-admin console** — user overview, workspace management, backup/restore, announcements to every user.
- 🧪 **Demo sandbox** — `/demo` runs entirely in the browser on sample data, no sign-in needed.
- 🌍 **Two languages** — English and Russian UI (Lingui).

## 🚀 Quick start

Requirements: **Node.js 20+**, **Docker Desktop**.

```bash
make up      # full local stack: Postgres, Keycloak, Supabase services, web
make down    # stop
make logs    # follow logs
```

| Service | URL |
|---|---|
| App | http://localhost:5173 |
| Keycloak | http://localhost:8081 |
| Supabase Gateway health | http://localhost:8080/health |
| Postgres | `localhost:54322` |

`make up` generates `.env` with dev secrets, applies Liquibase migrations and
synchronizes Keycloak ↔ Supabase — no manual setup needed.

Production, remote deploy and releases: see [docs/operations.md](docs/operations.md).

## 🏗 Architecture

| Layer | Technologies |
|---|---|
| **Frontend** | Vite · React 18 · TypeScript · Zustand · TanStack Query · Tailwind · Radix UI |
| **Backend** | Supabase, self-hosted (Postgres · GoTrue · PostgREST · Edge Functions) |
| **Auth / SSO** | Keycloak (OIDC) · oauth2-proxy (fallback for non-public paths) |
| **Infrastructure** | Docker Compose · Caddy (TLS edge) · Nginx (Supabase gateway) · Liquibase · standalone backup-service |

```
Browser → Caddy (TLS) → SPA (web) → Supabase GoTrue /auth/v1 → Keycloak (OIDC)
```

In production Caddy is the edge (TLS, domains, security headers) and the SPA starts
sign-in itself; oauth2-proxy stays as a fallback catch-all for non-public paths.

## 🤝 Contributing

1. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/my-feature` (the licence does not grant redistribution — see [LICENSE](./LICENSE)).
2. `npm install`, then bring up the stack: `make up`.
3. Add tests and keep it clean: `npm run test`, `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`,
   `bash infra/scripts/lint-security-definer.sh`, `npm run build`
   (plus `npm run test:integration` when touching RPC/RLS/cron).
4. New UI strings go through Lingui: `npm run lingui:extract && npm run lingui:compile`.
   Stale catalogs fail both CI and the production deploy.
5. Log the change with `make logchange RU="…" EN="…" [TYPE=added|changed|fixed|removed|security]`
   — it writes the entry into the `Unreleased` section of both changelogs (ru and en).
   Then open a PR with a clear description.

Merging into `main` deploys nothing: production only goes out via `make deploy`.
